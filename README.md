# Brain MR Image Tumor Classifier

## Pre-requisites for executing the code:

-	The datasets should be placed in the same directory while executing the code. 
-	The code is run and tested in Jupyter Notebook.
-	“CNNwithPytorch_Model.ipynb” and “VGG16withPytorch_Model.ipynb” use the MRI_Data dataset. 
-	“CNNwithKeras_Model.ipynb” uses MRI_Data_Keras dataset.
-	Use the zipped data set, do not extract the contents of the folder. It is taken care in the code itself.
-	PIP should be installed before installing and importing all the packages mentioned in the notebook.
-	For CV2, OpenCV should be installed; for PIL, pillow should be installed.
-   Download the sav file of our model from this link: https://buffalo.box.com/s/5rbes0gi7xk9ch23i98x7cavjhbvcqr4 (Github doesnot allow to push more than 100 MB file)
-	The “.command” file and “.sav” file are created for the UI. It works only on Mac.
